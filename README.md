node_js_practice, my first node js project
Following the tutorial on https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_intro.asp

Currently on Node Url module.


Update: - Some of the packages to be installed via npm in the tutorial requires 
access to some laptop facilities like images and calendar, mail etc. so permissions need to be adjusted to accomodate


To think about:
Could I use node functions in react to store state in say a file? 
    But take your time malcolm and enjoy the process of learning. There may be a more efficient way of storing state at no expense of space
